title: "Making thematic (historical) maps with R"

This online walkthrough accompanies a 2h "show-and-tell" workshop on **making thematic (historical) maps with R**. 

The worked example using historical 1851 census-data from *The occupational structure of Britain 1379-1911*-project will demonstrate how to load, explore and plot spatial data, with a focus on showing how spatial data can be integrated in an "regular" R [tidyverse data-analysis workflow](https://www.tidyverse.org/). 

The examples demonstrate mainly static maps, but interactive thematic maps are included as well. R packages demonistrated are primary [tmap](https://github.com/mtennekes/tmap#tmap-thematic-maps-in-r) and [mapview](https://r-spatial.github.io/mapview/).

Intended audience is basic R users (or those interested in seeing what R can do), who wish integrate spatial data into their "regular" (exploratory) data-analysis workflow, or who need a quick map. More advanced [GIS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographic_information_system)-topics such as projection fall outside of the scope. 

The material and examples are structured along the basic steps you generally take when making thematic maps:

0. [Motivating examples](00_start_examples.html) of static and interactive thematic maps.
1. [Load spatial (map) data](01_get_maps.html) to visualise your data on.
2. [Load and add](02_add_data.html) the data-of-interest you wish to visualise.
3. Jointly [manipulate](03_manipulate.html) your spatial and "regular" data.
4. Finally, [plot and tweak your map](04_plot.html).

I like [hearing from you](https://mhermans.net/#contact) if this walkthrough has been useful somehow, if something is not working or can be improved, or if you are interested in a workshop. 

# Download the material

You can copy-past the code snippets from these online pages, [download](https://github.com/mhermans/historical-maps-r/archive/master.zip) the entire set of material, or [clone from Github](https://github.com/mhermans/historical-maps-r).

Opening the file `historical-maps-r.Rproj` in the downloaded folder launches an Rstudio-project, after which you should be able to open, adapt, and run the Rmarkdown notebooks containing the examples (files ending in .Rmd).
