We need to have "bank maps" to color in. Two sources:

1. Dowloaded file [focus].
2. Provided through an R-package [see other workshop].

Points of attention:

* We want sf-objects. Frequently already right format, or convert using [`st_as_sf()`](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/reference/st_as_sf.html).
* Reduce large map to what you need: filter, crop, or limit.
* Pay attention to included identifier for merging.

```{r}
library(dplyr)   # tidyverse datamanipulation library
library(sf)      # tidyverse spatial features library
library(janitor) # utility function clean_names()
library(mapview)
library(tmap)
```


```{r}
census1851_districts <- st_read(
  file.path(Sys.getenv('DATADIR_HIVA_LOCAL'), 'ukda_occuphist_1851/1851_england_wales_census_registration_districts/1851EngWalesRegistrationDistrict.shp')) %>%
  clean_names() # utility function from library janitor

```


```{r}

mapview(census1851_districts)
```
