# Some motivating examples

* Example we'll be working towards today: map of railways & secondary sector employment in England 1851.
* Example from [previous workshop](https://workshop.mhermans.net/thematic-maps-r/04_plot.html#add_layers_using_objects) on thematic maps.
* Basic examples of maps  using R package `tmap` [are online](https://github.com/mtennekes/tmap).
* Example [online press release](https://hiva.kuleuven.be/nl/nieuws/nieuwsitems/bruto-jobtoename-en-afname-in-beeld-voor-de-Belgische-regios-en-provincies) HIVA - KU Leuven with interactive map.
* Example of interactive [map with historical map layers](https://mhermans.net/post/mapping-leuvense-gangen/).

# Working with spatial data as regular data

The "tidyverse"

Consequences:

* Enables quick spatial exploration.
* More creative links.

# Worked example: rail & industry in 1851 England

Data-source: *The occupational structure of Britain 1379-1911*, [Cambridge Group for the History of Population and Social Structure](https://www.campop.geog.cam.ac.uk/research/occupations/).

Illustrating through exampes common steps for common thematic maps:

1. Get an appropriate blank map.
2. Load and add "regular" data.
3. Manipulate (spatial) data.
4. Plot map.
